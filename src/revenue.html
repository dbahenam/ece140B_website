    <h1>The Revenue</h1>
    <p>
        For our product revenue model, we plan on selling our product through retail, online and ad-based. 
        Our expected annual revenue for selling our product through retail would be $16,250 which is about 
        50% of our total annual revenue coming from retail sales. Our online expected annual revenue would
        be 35% of our total annual revenue so about $11,375. Our ad-based sales will be about 15% of our
        total annual revenue which will be $4875. We plan on selling our hardware product for a one time fee.
        
        We don't have a subscription fee in plan to include with our product. We are considering adding one
        to be able to automatically order grocery items that are almost out for our customers, but we still
        need to get more customer feedback on this idea.
