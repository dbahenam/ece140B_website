    <h1>Grocery Tracker</h1>
    <p>Our team plans to build a grocery tracker system that will help people know what 
        they have it in their refrigerator when they are doing grocery shopping. Our team will
        use a camera that will be inserted to the buyers refrigerator. The camera will take photos
        or videos of the groceries in the refrigerator. Those images will then be classified and
        their labels will be stored in a database. The information in the database will then be 
        displayed to our buyer which will then know what food items they currently have and which 
        they would want to buy.
