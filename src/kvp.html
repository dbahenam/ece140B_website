    <h1>The KVP</h1>
    <p>Our product will be valued by our customers because it will addresse a need
        that many people have. There are countless times where grocery shoppers go 
        to a store and are not sure if they have certain products at home or they have
        to remember to do a grocery shopping list before they go shopping. With our product
        our customers will not have to worry about that since they will be able to see what 
        products they have and what they need through our product's web app. 
    </p>
    <p>The reason why potential customers should choose us over any competion is because we 
        will provide real time answers to the question they have, without the cost of a new smart 
        refrigerator. There are also other apps that act as a grocery shopping list, but those apps 
        require users to manually add/delete whatever they put or take out of their refrigerator. Our
        product will not require our customers to do this since our product will be in charge of that.
