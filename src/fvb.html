    <p>
        In this week's update to your site, you'll add a new section/page that describes the 
        top 5 features of your product (ranked by user need) â€“ and distinguish these from the 
        associated benefits. 

        Make sure you're clear about each one, and identify which users (by persona) will benefit, along with 
        why this benefit is so important to them.

        Top 5 Features:
        1. Our product will feature a camera system that is simply attached to their refrigerator and will be
        able to keep track of their groceries in their fridge. This will be beneficial for customers who cannot
        afford to purchase a smart refrigerator which are very expensive.
        2. Our product will handle identifying the products in their refirgerator. This will help customers 
        who do not have the time to manually enter items they store into our app or have a need to write them down.
        3. Phone App that allow them to view their fridge contents wherever the customer may be. This will be
        beneficial for customers who go on grocery runs after work or after attending any type of event and 
        are not sure what products they currently have in their refrigerator.
        4. Our app will also have a feature to inform the user how many items of a certain food product they
        have. This will benefit customers who may only want a certain amount of items. Them knowing that they
        have milk may not be as informitive as knowing they have 2 gallons of milk which is what our product
        will tell them.
        5. Our product will also have the feature to recalibrate the camera system. This will be beneficial 
        for customers who may not know what to do if they notice our system not be able to capture items 
        accurately. They will not have to call a technician as they will be able to recalibrate the camera system
        through our app.
