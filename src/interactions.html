        The key product interactions that will be featured in our MVP, will be for the user to be able to 
        calibrate our camera system through our iOS app. They will also be able to see the current items stored
        in their fridge through the app as well through the app along with the number of items that they currently 
        have. Our app will be able to get this information through a url call which will help the user be
        able to see their items without having to be physically looking inside their fridge. Calibrating
        the camera will also be useful since this way if the user notices that the camera system isn't 
        reading the right items or not detecting certain items in a certain location of the fridge, they can
        recalibrate the system to make sure it is working properly again.
