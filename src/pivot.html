    <h1>Pivots:</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>Website to App:</h3>
        Originally we planned on having a website for our product where the user would be able to login
        and see the items they had in their refrigerator. However, we wanted our user to have very easy 
        access to find out what products they currently had in their fridge, so we decided to go with an 
        IOS app that customers would only need to log in and quickly see a table view of their items along
        with the number of items they currently have. 
    <p>
        This is a customer need pivot, since our target customers are tech savy adults who are either 
        homeowners or renters. We know our customer base prefers an app over a website so this is a change
        we needed to make for them.
    </p>

        <h3>Expiration Dates:</h3>
        When we first started to talk about how we wanted our product to work, we had an idea about 
        our grocery tracker being able to keep track experition dates of food items inserted into to
        the customer's refrigerator. However we had to pivot from this since we felt that adding that 
        functionality to our product would be extremely complicated to achieve during this quarter. 
        This is because we planned on tackling this issue by tracking food items printed expiration date,
        which is really hard to detect since each item can have their expiration date printed anywhere
        around the item and also it's usually printed in a small font size. A way around this would be to
        have the user manually type in the experitation data of each item into our app to be stored, but 
        this defeats one of our main goals which is not to add extra work for our customers. We decided to
        focus this quarter on implementing the necessary functionality for our camera system to be able to
        correctly identify grocery items and be able to count the number of items being stored in the 
        fridge.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a zoom in pivot because we abonded one idea to focus our attention on the main functionality
        of our product which is identifying items and counting them. This is the "bread and butter" of our
        product so we wanted to make sure this featured worked by the end of this quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Detection Algorithms:</h3>
        We first used Clarifai's image detection algorithm to detect our grocery items, but we recently changed
        to a YOLO algorithm trained by a dataset. Since Clarifai's algorithm did not give us a good result when
        counting items, we wanted to try something new.
    </p>
        This is a Technology Pivot since we still offer the same product functionality, just with more accurate results.
